on the few who are most detrimental to what america should stand for. most berkeley students would have protested but still allowed the milo speech to occur. it was an outside organization that saw to it that it didn't. while most of what took place that night was needless and terrible, it is in no way an indicator that free speech is dead. it just shows that on both sides of the political spectrum there are people who are willing to resort to violence and destruction to silence their opposition. sebastian seabass balaski aman - this takes boi to a new level rosa kwak, you know what to say. catherine seung hyun lee ayyyy lmao the free speech movement is dead. today, the berkeley college republicans' constitutional right to free speech was silenced by criminals and thugs seeking to cancel

brinda brandon huelga jo erickson siddharth kulkarni f xosthan abarca stephanie tang, do the roasts begin? the free speech movement is dead. today, the berkeley college republicans' constitutional right to free speech was silenced by criminals and thugs seeking to cancel milo yiannopoulos' tour. their success is a defeat for civilized society and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses across america. we would like to thank ucpd and the university administration for doing all they could to ensure the safety of everyone involved. it is tragic that the birthplace of the free speech movement is also its final resting place. b& gustavo garcia jr. spicy kat mediavilla anthony vogliano  connor dolan yi zhao estefan\u00eda arroyo garcia tanner dekock franklin rice obligatory tag aria

offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. laura diaz fernanda aguila elizabeth twichell devon dibello phillip downey meha bakshi jane phan im screaming charles uday zing

(nd urself pls) as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. these are not public fuunds where

monster disappear. john wesley mysteriously made performing this action after infant baptism both mandatory and optional in his revision of the book of common prayer, though it is uncommon in methodist practice. orthodox christians hold their (*) thumb, index finger, and middle finger together while performing this action from right to left. this practice is performed alongside the trinitarian formula, the saying of \"in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit.\" for 10 points, name this blessing in which one traces the object christ was crucified upon.\nanswer: making the sign of the cross thanks for putting in the work on these relatable wholesome memes. alejandro garcia just trying to post non- eecs/haas ones for a change ;p if i'm not

cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. josh ko this is pretty

james carrjames bartlettconnor worley chris tril leon babaev daniil care to translate okay i wanted to rant about this and i realized that was dumb and then remembered that's why i made a finsta. fuck chris tril. this moron has run a booming meme page into the ground with moronic decisions like renaming it to a furry appreciation page and stopping new posts for hours at a time for no reason. but this is what made me leave. ucbmfet was great because of the diverse perspectives it allowed instead of just being a berkeley circlejerk. banning non-cal students l i t e r a l l y violates free speech. in conclusion, make ucbmfet great again. now i will literally never talk about this again. @ everyone in this group tim salerno lmao underrated fuck standord alejandro barrientos sleep tight pupper alex kierlanczyk jaryeong kim \u043d\u0435\u0435\u0435\u0442 i feel like chris  tril just gave up on being nice and is now just a troll rosa kwak phillip this is pretty damn accurate lucy an live footage of when your meme got deleted matt holtzer ur such a fckn nor is lucy oliveros kek alyssa yue anthony pham ricky pan lel carina wijaya ditto rangga kasendar as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. narek, vahan, mher :d :d .\nw e w l a d\ne\nw\nl\na\nd chris tril ew someone's

food chain is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that memers are slaves to a capitalist agenda is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body this is lowkey how meme pages die tbh didn't know haas students controlled this group at least sell out to kfc or wendy's

comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific majors to how the world actually works is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that business majors have it easy is demeaning

like renaming it to a furry appreciation page and stopping new posts for hours at a time for no reason. but this is what made me leave. ucbmfet was great because of the diverse perspectives it allowed instead of just being a berkeley circlejerk. banning non-cal students l i t e r a l l y violates free speech. in conclusion, make ucbmfet great again. now i will literally never talk about this again.

at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the

alton lin what the fuck not gonna lie, i came a little bit. thien phan inspiration oskirotica: part 2\n\npine. musk. cheap perfume from previous conquests.\ni was walking past vlsb when i smelled the unmistakable smell of manhood. this is what porn sets probably smell like. my nipples immediately stiffened and i felt my womanhood moisten in just the slightest. i knew. that moment, even though i was in public, i wanted to be bent over on the side of the bridge and fucked until it would hurt to walk the next morning.\n\u201cplease, daddy\u201d\nhe looked at me with the same intensity that he would eyeball a jumping salmon from an upstream creek. his primal instincts were kicking in, and oh baby i was ready. to make babies with this sex symbol. \n\u201crawr\u201d\ni know that that means to beg more. and  will happily do it, anything to please oski. even though he isn\u2019t inside of me yet i can feel myself soaking through my panties, and with that i beg harder, i\u2019m not sure to satisfy myself or to satisfy him. \n\u201cplease\u201d\n\u201crawwwwrrrrrrr!!\u201d\nit ached as he slipped in. but i took it. i took it for oski. as i felt the velvety touch of his balls against my virgin ass, i only began to realize that others could see us. but it was okay. i wanted them to see. i wanted them to hear my pleasure as he plunged his veiny cock inside and out of me, pounding me balls-deep as i ached to take in every inch of him. \nas he climaxed inside of my ass, while his delicious pearly white cum was dripping generously down my trembling legs like melted ice cream in august, deep enough to drown a toddler, he let out nine words that would seep into my dreams for as long as i will live.\n\"tell the whole damn world this is bear territory\" crystal zhang wake up

not bad at all. your meme, i mean. it's not bad. a good first attempt. it's plenty dank... i can tell it's got some thought behind it... lots of quotable material... but memeing isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. you're skilled... that much i can tell. but do you have what it takes to be a memester? to join those esteemed meme ranks? to call yourself a member of the ruseman's corps? memeing takes talent, that much is true. but more than that it takes heart. the world-class memesters - i mean the big guys, like johnny hammersticks and billy kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. and you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's \"tryhard,\" or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest shitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. the meme game is rough, kid, and i don't just mean the one you just lost :). it's a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your meme bakery, some cocksucker at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some shit that a million different johnny no-names will attach a milion different captions to. chin up, kid. don't get all mopey on me. you've got skill. you've got talent. you just need to show your drive. see you on the boards... dalia

this apply to you or me and should we get started on oskirotica 6? for those who missed it\n\noskirotica 5: rogue one\n\nswipe left\nswipe left\n...maybe? nah, swipe left\nswipe left\nyes, i\u2019m on tinder. i\u2019m not kidding myself, i\u2019m not looking for a \u2018relationship\u2019 or \u2018friendship\u2019\nit was friday and i wanted some hot dick.\nafter finals week, i wanted to be bent over and fucked consensually\n\u2026\noh yes. this was it.\n\u2026\nswipe right\nhis eyes, oh god, his eyes, they were gorgeous\ni couldn\u2019t swipe right fast enough.\n\nit was him. it was definitely him, his ears gave it away. the biggest sex symbol on campus. who\u2019s yellow jacket was soaked in pussy juice 24/7. oski. oski bear.\n\nmy heart raced as i awaited the long overdue \u201cit\u2019s a match!\u201d notification. oh god, please. \n\n20 seconds later and it came. ding. and so did i. my thighs quivered as i darted for my phone. jesus has answered my prayers. i was getting fucked tonight. and i was going to call \u2018oh my god\u2019 until morning.\n\nafter a cheesy stock pickup line and a few winky faces with more than one parentheses he agreed to meet up at my place. i only had 15 minutes to shave my cooch, so i had to hurry. i was out of shaving cream and it felt like i was shaving with kerosene, but it was okay because it was about to get lit af later tonight.\n\nthe doorbell rang. \nmy heart started to pound.\ni opened the door, but instead of roses and chocolate there was four loko and a dorito stained shirt. well, who needs all that time to waste on romantic shit like eating chocolate when we could go straight to the dick. i grabbed him by his sweaty palm caked with dorito dust and took him into my dorm. \n\nmy roommate was sitting there and i put a sock on the door and glared at her until she got the message. she was talking to her mom and the reception outside was better anyways.\n\nwe sat on my bed. it was time for dust the cobwebs and get to business.\n\n\u2018uh, hey\u2019 i start, always being the cautious one, \u2018do you have protection?\nthe tang center pharmacy has you covered with name brand, low-cost, no hassle traditional condoms: 10 for $2, or 10 for $2.50 for larger size options. free condoms and other safer sex supply samples are also available during health and wellness coaching appointments, as well as through health promotion outreach events and workshops. condoms can be a sexy adventure for you and your partner. try them in a variety of materials, sizes, colors, textures, and flavors! (flavored condoms are for mouth-to-penis/toy play, and are not recommended for vaginal or anal penetration.)\u2019\n\n\u2018no, i won\u2019t need that\u2019 he growls with a cheeky grin that led me to swipe right in the first place. i looked at his cheeky buttocks. i was sooooo moist that i briefly considered being a mom by going in raw.\n\nhe climbs on top of my mounds and plunges his pinky finger inside of my slit. \n\nmy eyes widen, as i expected the main course and not the appetizer. he began wheezing as he got faster and faster fingerbanging me while repeating \u2018do you like that baby\u2019, and i was transported to a world of \u2018oh shit, did i leave my laundry in the washer?\u2019. my pussy got drier by the second as i began thinking where i went wrong in life and also what to eat for dinner later that night. for the first time i actually felt something, but it was the friction of my dry pussy on his fingertips. i didn\u2019t even bother faking an orgasm, but he noticed i checked out and started sniffing my panties until he busted his nut from the scent of unshowered, raw muff. \n\ngood god i was embarrassed for him. enough was enough. \n\n\u2018please get out.\u2019 i laughed\n\u2018did you like that baby?\u2019 he said panting for breath and looking for his lanyard\n\u2018it was...interesting\u2019 i said, \u2018but i uh, forgot i have the, uh, thing to go to\u2019\n\u2018do you wanna meet my mom on the next date? she\u2019s been asking about you\u2019\nhe obviously wasn\u2019t getting the hint, so i scooted him out of my dorm and shut the door. what a fuckboi. what a fingerboi?\nback on tinder\nswipe left\nswipe left\nswipe left\noh\u2026\na boy caught my eye. slender. sharply dressed. a little nerdy, with little

at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body as a member of the meme community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. memes at uc

find this joke to be in very bad taste.  the republican party is going through a very difficult time that is not entirely their fault.  it reminds me somewhat of the experience the whig party had before it crumbled and its remnants were reformed into the republican party in the 1850s.  many people in 1860 doubted abraham lincoln too, but he was given a chance to rally his people and we saw the kind of success he had.  if we refuse to let paul ryan compromise with the more populist branch of his party we are essentially just inviting another teddy roosevelt scenario.  he fragmented the republican party, putting woodrow wilson in the white house.  you can argue about who the better president would have been for the time, but the majority of americans were certainly more in favor of a candidate from the republican party than the democratic party.  the bull moose party came about because of a powerful republican's refusal to compromise.  maybe as berkeley students we don't agree with the arguments laid out in the republican platform but they were still elected with a sweeping electoral mandate and it's our duty now to come to terms with that in a more productive manner than this.  i agree that there is a severe lack in diversity among paul ryan's staff but unleashing our edginess on him is both shallow and pedantic josh papernik. elizabeth bricker paul ryan sees nothing

community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. matthew chang won park nick riasanovsky putting those rubber duckies to good

school rivalry? as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is

uc berkeley memes for edgy teens this is highly offensive. non-berkeley students at uc berkeley memes for edgy teens make it their goal to give memes a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing other colleges to a meme about being a non-memer is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that non-berkeley students don't belong is demeaning the memes and values uc berkeley memes for edgy teens is founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on ucbmet that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. justin hekmat allegra koch me mindy wangus

jackie ueng welcome joseph as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. welcome joseph

for all. everyone deserves equal access. \n\njoining this meme page was once something to be proud of. originally, only the best memes would make it to the top. some of us, it seems, have forgotten

did, i must admit, i had myself a good chuckle. i typically don't find 'internet humor' especially amusing or relatable, in fact it took me years to figure out what an 'youtube' was. nonetheless, in today's bitter political climate, i find solace in a little bit of an injection of humor into this crazy world. anyways, good job, hope to see more of this in the future. rebeka louise grammenos

should have said thisss omggg person 1: \n\nif you think about it, this entire sub has gone completely mental. just imagine what this would all look like without the internet medium between us. first, one guy shows everyone a picture, then everybody else begins laughing and parroting phrases back and forth. everybody in a room, just repeating shit over and over, \"me too thanks!\" \"me too thanks!\" then someone takes the picture, and draws something else on top of it; usually something we can all recognize from before. and everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, \"o shit waddup\" \"90kg projectile!\" \"me too thanks!\" if you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. in fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. we keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. we're all stuck in the loony bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness. and i don't know if i can fucking take it anymore, one of these days i'm just going to lose every last bit of san- lol i mean me too thanks.\n\n\nperson 2: haha i wonder if someone will post this on overheard \n\n-overheard in daddy denero's webcast tejas priyadarshan u faris katkhuda molly goss caroline burget

of the tests for other sections... cheating other people of their hard work studying and cheating the professor out of his time and fulfillment of teaching.\nand just one month ago, michael grimes from morgan stanley gave a talk in anderson bluntly saying that he sees haas recruits as relatively low integrity. i am not sure if mr. grimes was the one to say this, but other schools have signals if you see somebody cheating, such as tapping your desk with your pencil (without looking at the cheater or anything). do we need something like this? it\u2019s not about calling people out, it would work as a deterrent.\nregardless, there is no reason we should need a deterrent. i should hope that everyone in our community at haas values becoming a better person over a higher grade, money, or whatever incentives are here to taunt us away from what really matters. good luck with the rest of your finals, study hard but remember to take a breath and keep things in perspective. alex vu well

mean gorls eve muramura as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. omg denero lol this is perfection

jacqueline miranda alice ma shoot me god dambit why are you ppl like dis john hamilton well, you do make a good point. however, perspective is also important. there's not much grade inflation at cal; in fact there's a lot of grade deflation. many students will get c+'s in classes in which they are just slightly below the average. while consistently worrying about bad grades is not healthy, it's not that people at cal have no self-confidence or grade self esteem (at least i think). many of these people are actually going to get b's and c's despite working as hard as they can because the competition is so tough. this is especially true for many technical classes; you can grasp the concepts well but still struggle on the tests because the tests are meant to be tricky and will test your ability to apply your skills to problems you have never seen before. in this type of environment, i think it's natural for people to want to vent their disappointment, so making the situation comical is a good way to do that. also, most cal students got straight a's or close to straight a's in high school, so when they get b's and c's in their freshman year at cal they are understandably disappointed and will feel like their semester is a failure, worth shit, etc etc. chris ho yana slabakov francisco valdez the new trend is starting i know a famous person now \u270c\ud83c\udffc\ufe0f

lol he's the greatest erika keer this is why we chose 122 anjalie gulati you should've came here just for searle damn you searle gabriel remember when searle was asking if any students wanted to be his gardener? lorena basically all old philosophy professors john searle? like chinese room john searle? that's dope searle is a \"top notch\" professor? i guess if making your students buy all of your books on a subject, then over-simplifying the arguments of other philosophers in lecture when those arguments don't cohere with yours, and then pretty much arguing that those arguments are wrong because they aren't your arguments and not qualifying your assertions much more than that, then yea. in that case, the guy is definitely \"top notch.\" melissa pangilinan i love searle. tfw the philosophy department is just rigged to have students buy your books anyway and then ignore the syllabus (cough noe, searle) sydney lee harriet whitehead lol gd luck with this prof next semester david

they might be legit? at least put a cal logo on it wish they were at least funny sounds liberal but ok when the mods fight fascists with fascism :/ to add insult to injury they were all so bad when these fascists send their memesters, they\u2019re not sending their best. they\u2019re not sending you. they\u2019re sending memesters that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. they\u2019re bringing un-original content. they\u2019re not funny. they\u2019re reposters. and some, i assume, are good people.  this page idk what this post is about, but lets stop

should be a new copy pasta. discipline me daddy ill be your docile body anytime ;) as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. cari gotta love those panoptic structures felix gg foucault ajay raj foucault and the technologies of the self raj agrawal john markham austin guo cory mccubbrey nabeel

not a meme, b& as a member of the ucbmfet community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. memers at uc berkeley make it their goal to give memers a place to feel comfortable as well as better the meme community. comparing specific memers to students from different schools is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that memers are low-quality is demeaning the memehood and the lack of values it is founded on. this clearly is a stab at the meme community on campus that does nothing but support itself. recently, ucbmfet has drifted. this is both

name is daquan but u can call me t3h n1gga of d00m!!!!!!!! bruh\u2026as u can see im a real savage. thats why i came here, 2 meet \ud83d\udcaf% no chill ppl like me\u2026 im 16 years old (i got first hand street experience tho!!) i like 2 netflix n chill w/ my sidepiece (cuz you know this ain't my main one, smdh) bcuz da pussy is straight fire!!!! shes savage 2 of course but i want 2 meet more savage ppl =) like they say the more lit the squad the more lit the pussy!!!! lol\u2026neways i hope 2 make a big squad here so give me lots of retweets!!!! whythisniggadrakelooklikeasaudiwarlord?????!!!!!!!!!! <--- me bein savage again _^ hehe\u2026stay real fam!!! ! ! here's the thing. you said a \"pupper is a doggo.\"\nis it in the same family? yes. no one's arguing that.\nas someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, i am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers doggos. if you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. they're not the same thing.\nif you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).\nso your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people \"call the small yip yip ones doggos?\" let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.\nalso, calling someone a human or an ape? it's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. they're both. a pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. but that's not what you said. you said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. which you said you don't.\nit's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?  recently, ucbmfet has drifted. this is both because of recent changes in modstyle

breathed heavily into the phone. \"so it's settled then,\" he asked, setting his ipad on the desk \"the money will be transferred tuesday?\n\n\"yes,\" replied the voice on the other line. \"i was able to move some things around. a little off the top here and there - the asuc will have less funding for club spaces next semester but no one should notice. i don't foresee any difficulties as long as you hold up your end of the deal.\"\n\n\"don't worry about that.\" dirks paused to mop the sweat from his forehead. \"although, if i might ask, why was it you need access to the registry of all eecs

over as soon as the funds transfer.\"\n\n\"see that you do. pleasure doing business, chancellor.\"\n\n\"same to you. and goodluck, joseph.\"\n\ndirks hung up his phone and sat in silence, perhaps contemplating the scope of what he was doing. he knew that public funds belonged just there - the public - but something inside of him clawed at his inhibitions, consuming him with visions of free workouts or trips to east asia. \n\neventually he escaped his daze and picked up his ipad, returning to the home depot webpage he had last browsed. he selected a section of fencing even bigger and more protective then that public funds had procured for his house last year. \n\nhe ran his fingers across the screen. \"soon..\" he whispered. tina cao ac dela paz new fanfiction for you crystal lin

community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. typical eecs post but we have the dankest memes.  who's laughing now? iris melody xu sriram velmanikandan  tony zheng as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. what the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? i\u2019ll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals, and i\u2019ve been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda, and i have over 300 confirmed kills. i am trained in gorilla warfare and i\u2019m the top sniper in the entire us armed forces. you are nothing to me but just another target. i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth, mark my fucking words. you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet? think again, fucker. as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. you\u2019re fucking dead, kid. i can be anywhere, anytime, and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that\u2019s just with my bare hands. not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat, but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. but you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. you\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo. yo les noobs fernando reyes lol yall are pathetic russell cheng would u talk shit about gosu if u saw him at lan the saddest thing you realize is that on here and the berkeley page, 50\u2105 of the memes are just south campus majors bashing north campus majors because they are trying to justify their decisions in life and unhappiness in the strange hope that their suffering will have been worth it when most times if they don't like it now...it won't be. not a meme ot but why's your fb tag 'onii.chan.daisuki' dude nice jake and amir reference venkata srikar poreddy seiji sakiyama see this j&a reference? aaron zhang artemis skiardia im dying hahahahaha shit oh sheesh angery reacts only pls as a member of the greek yogurt community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. greek yogurt at uc berkeley makes it their goal to give lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus bacteria a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific greek yogurts to characters from a yogurt commercial about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that greek yogurts are cliques is demeaning the \u2018yogurt cultures\u2019 they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a greek yogurt community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. until the 1900s, yogurt was a staple in diets of people in the russian empire. as a member of the non-greek community and not a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. memers at uc berkeley memes for edgy teens make it their goal to give memers a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to fictional characters from a movie was supposed to be taken as a joke, unless you doont have a sense of humor. making the claim that memers

kashish singh dylan mendonca u should get this instead you tell them fckin showed me great meme 11/10 as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. we need to make this meme page work for everyone, not just for the top tenth of 1% well, this is all honestly way too much. either no memes are posted or all memes are. letting the mods cherry-pick their favorites is completely unfair. cater to the meme needs of all of us, not just a select few. otherwise, you shouldn't even be running this page. memes should be a public good for all. everyone deserves equal access.\njoining this meme page was once something to be proud of. originally, only the best memes would make it to the top. some of us, it seems, have forgotten that. even i've shitposted way too much these past few days. please, let's not forget why we once loved memes so much. hell, just read the first letter of every sentence and you'll remember.  this is amazing we need to drain the meme swamp and eradicate meme cronyism aiden amir rafii yesssssss https://www.facebook.com/groups/101509313659176/ who is joseph? this is so awesome welcome joseph? who is joseph? claudia chan as a member of uc berkeleys memes for edgy teens page and meme community this is highly offensive. edgy teens at uc berkeley make it their goal to give teens a place to feel edgy as well as make memes for the community. comparing specific memes to edgy teens from a group about memes is absurd and not edgy. making the claim that edgy teens are cliques is demeaning the edgyhood and edginess they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community that does nothing but roast the shit out of the rest of the student body. marisa liang james

offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. sterling tuma as a member of the russian community and a part of one of these organizations i must inform you that you are sentenced to stefan zukin

police brutality, being starving and broke cause their parents can't pay for them to be in a frat like yours did. i know this message does not apply to everyone in the greek system but omg its a meme

as a member of the greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. sororities at uc berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. \u249c\u24ae \u249c \u24a8\u24a0\u24a8\u249d\u24a0\u24ad

though. talking it out helps, though. yikes this is too edgy this is actually a problem. i hate how normalized these problems have become on campus and how increasingly expected it's become for undergrads. is anyone actually working to improve accessibility to resources and actively change the culture surrounding this? nate magee ayy harim lee su jin nam so i am a berkeley student!! wow!! priyanka potdar us joshua price never seen anything more relevant amy mao yes, depression and mental health is a huge issue within uc berkeley and college students as a whole. more than 1000 college students committed suicide last year in the us. i'm missing the joke here? i havent been to classes in 2 weeks honestly this post is really really concerning. if you're a person suffering with any of these problems, there are resources on campus to help you. cal offers free counseling services if you have ship, and else you get 5 counseling appointments (plus 3 extra with a $15 co-pay) and will be referred to a professional on your insurance plan. i recommend giving counseling/therapy a chance, because these professionals are dedicated to making sure our lives are okay!

it's better just not to post it :/ brittnie t. phan julie wong stale meme sierra gomez like uma krishnan said utilise these resources. mental health is not a joke!!!! we're privileged enough to have

whatever just hmu not edgy enough maggie cabrera honestly.... won park lol this might be the wrong place to post this, but swe has an event for making care packages coming up (do not need to be a woman and/or engineer) and confi at cal has resources. daniel wolfgang stewart su jin nam sahar hashemian vivi nguyen i feel personally attacked by this relatable content stephanie oahc \"go bears\" elizabeth rivers manesy cevallos kairui zeng serena dhillon jonathan gong prerana nadig w e l l what does deep self-loathing fall under? nammi baru guys, if you're dealing with the symptoms of depression seen here, especially suicidal ideation or anything that affects your day-to-day life, please get help. i understand that the humor in the post helps people relate, but it's not healthy to act like depression and severe mental health issues are something you should just put up with or even \"proof\" that you work hard. counseling at the tang center is free with/without ship, there's peer-to-peer counseling if you don't want to go to tang, or even bring it up with your primary care doctor. \nhttps://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling vianca benitez hahahahahhahahaha sounds like cornell
