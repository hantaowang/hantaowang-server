always looking out for you tempted to spam my professor with lorem ipsum and we haven't started finals yet hello friends,\nas you probably have seen in the recent days, joseph has gained much popularity and became a 'meme' on this page. initially, i met joseph on one faithful day in senegal and we instantly became friends. a few days ago, he saw me tagging iris in a post and saw the group on his newsfeed so he requested to join as he wanted to make new friends. however, he did not expect this to become a thing and he currently has 631 friend requests as of now (in addition to the people he has already accepted). though he would like to be friends with you all, the constant messages and messenger calls at midnight here from y'all have made him a bit crazy about the attention that he's been getting. many of you have seen recent screenshots of chats that he have sent some people and were weirded out by some of his messages. since i know joseph personally from being with him in senegal, i know that he only really wants to make friends and the social etiquette here is a lot different from that of the u.s. with all that, he also told me that he enjoys some of the memes that you have made and he loves uc berkeley and would definitely want to visit the school someday, although you should probably use the money on that gofundme for a charity. all in all, he wishes you the best of luck on your finals and to keep memeing. when you go to office hours to ask a quick question but their answer is more complicated than what you expected every damn time when you been writing an essay, but spending too much time on ucbmfet that eecs life: a youtube series tag your friends top notch berkeley professor straight up says \"ignore the syllabus\" a week before the exam sad reacts only pls stay strong fam, only one week left when it's dead week but it's also saturday night... when ucbmfet infultrates every aspect of your life when you use the study guide but the exam is the total opposite of what you studied for. angerey reacts only checking my grades over break, like when airbears 2 won't connect, desperate times call for desperate measures something positive for finals week... the irony.. type #kanyesmile and you will get  right side playlist 15 minutes after you comment on or get tagged in a post *fixed* when the professor says attendance is mandatory and

joseph\ncomment for hill larry tfw your class and final paper is a meme ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) logic of debugging cs projects be like:  joseph, i guess this is goodbye :'( haha got 'em attention ucbmfet:\n\nwe thank you for your cooperation and patience these past 24+ hours. in a few short moments, posts will no longer be subject to approval. \n\nfrom now until december 16th, the moderating team will not be readily addressing most of your concerns. this may come a shock to some of you but, the ucbmfet team (with the exception of chris tril) is human. we, like many of you, are also students with finals to study for, and we do not get paid to regulate a facebook group with 36k+ members, so please bear with us. if outrageous shit gets posted, and we do not address it in .02 seconds as we normally do, please understand that we do have more important things than correcting the idiocies of our more edgy posters. \n\nwith that said, we kindly ask that you try your best at not being absolute shitheads to one another and posting disrespectful content to specific individuals or particular groups of individuals.so have fun and don't spend too much time on this cancerous facebook group when you should be studying for finals.\n\n\u2014this message has been brought to you by sizzler\u2122(now you're talking) and the administrative and moderating team of uc berkeley memes for edgy teens\n\np.s.: \"as a member of the greek...\" memes are getting old at an absurdly rapid pace. joseph goodluck senpai, please carry us as we take our finals when ur tinder match isnt ur soulmate... sad reacts only :( i know that this isn't a meme but please be nice. why did ya'll remove that guy for posting the link to the goodluck joseph group thing? our new prince joseph goodluck when you start trying to meet people in your classes now for last-minute finals help but they're onto you welcome joseph (to the dark side) is anyone willing to pitch in like a dollar to fly joseph goodluck out here to bless us with good luck before and during finals? i think in total it'd cost around $2500 since flights from nigeria are expensive especially on short notice but if 1/10th of people all pitched in a singular dollar we could totally do it. if there's enough interest i'll set up a go fund me or a kickstarter if it hadn't been for goodluck joe\ni'd been meme-less a long time ago\nwhere did you come from\nwhere did you go\nwhere did you come from\ngoodluck joe\n\nsad reacts only a meme so edgy it couldn't be expressed with just one meme me too thanks me trying to save the semester. helpful tool for everybody who has an econ final. things get weird after midnight recently, ucbmfet has drifted. this is both because of recent changes in modstyle resulting in a pretty light/lax mod presence as well as an influx of users who don't really understand what ucbmfet is about and treat it as just another repost depository. we don't want to eliminate user input but 40,000 people from lesser meme schools joining the group and diluting content quality down to stanford/ucla meme levels isn't democratic user input - a democratic society requires its population to be educated about its values and ideologies to have productive dialogues. joining this group with no knowledge of its history and then arguing that it should be more like stanford or ucla memes isn't constructive. ucbmfet is very intentionally trying to distance itself from those cultures. we video chatted joseph goodluck  at 4 in the morning!!! my reaction when joseph revealed his true nature. sorry joseph. everyone in this group? recently, ucbmfet has drifted. this is both because of recent changes in modstyle resulting in a pretty light/lax mod presence as well as an influx of users who don't really understand what ucbmfet is about and treat it as just another repost depository. we don't want to eliminate user input but 40,000 people from lesser meme schools joining the group and diluting content quality down to stanford/ucla meme levels isn't democratic user input - a democratic society requires its population to be educated about its values and ideologies to have productive dialogues. joining this group with no knowledge of its history and then arguing that it should be more like stanford or ucla memes isn't constructive. ucbmfet is very intentionally trying to distance itself from those cultures. a metaphor it's friday... you used to meme me on my cell phone\noriginal savagery creds to iris melody xu resume writing be like dead week got me feeling this weather makes me want to die, but then again, so does dead week. my game plan. as a member of the non-berkeley student community and a part of ucbmfet this is highly offensive. meme pages make it their goal to give individuals like joseph a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. comparing google searches is absurd and beyond inaccurate. making the claim that non-berkeley students do not belong in this clique is demeaning the intimacy and values this page was founded on. this clearly is a stab at a community not on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body. mod shitpost. study hard and see you edgelords in a week como miembro de la comunidad griega y parte de una de estas organizaciones esto es muy ofensivo. las sororidades de mujeres en la universidad de california, berkeley hacen su objetivo de presentarle a las mujeres un lugar para sentirse c\u00f3modas para mejorar la comunidad. comparando casas espec\u00edficas a personajes de una pel\u00edcula sobre el acoso es absurdo y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de inexacta. hacer la afirmaci\u00f3n de que las sororidades de mujeres son camarillas degrada la sororidad y los valores con que se fundan. esto claramente es una herida en una comunidad que no hace nada menos que apoyar al resto del cuerpo estudiantil. \"can i borrow your phone?\"\nme: \"sure, one sec\" http://cs.stanford.edu/ is down :o

pick one @ that friend who never contributes the only motivation i needed to get out of bed this morning... \"dont worry we have all of dead week to study\" when something is labeled free at uc berkeley it hurts but you gott 2 life isn't so bad when the final is 40% and you know you're about to fail it. this needs to be a lower div for eecs majors, along with pubhealth 27: how to shower. ucb memes for edgy teens right now ucbmfet the last few days friend: you ready for finals?\nme: i've been studying everyday for 2 weeks, of course i'm ready. should i do it? :^) realize real lies real eyes - ucbmfet sees u and knows adding \"for horny teens\" is still a rip off of both our and ucsb's original meme page when you would rather land in a toxic pit than continue this week when you get one sheet of notes for the exam no one was even there.... am i too late? too bad i don't want to write papers. joesph has become an official part of uc berkeley sad reacts only :(((( when a seat in moffitt opens up. dead week got me like vegan meme finals be like:\n...\n(wait for it) follow your heart the admins are studying! we are free to do whatever we want. post ponies. sad reacts :((( when i forget webcasts are supposed to be more than just background noise\n\n 3edgy5me when you go insane and start talking to squirrels two days into dead week... edit: comments disabled :'( leave free speech alone! \nshots fired stanford memes for edgy trees when u find out 61a next semester is gonna be taught by hilfinger but u had denero i sent my dna in for sequencing, these were the results that came back review session gsi trying to explain this semester like to those who worship other schools' meme pages over ucbmfet: just remember that w e  a r e  n u m b e r  o n e eecs_irl test post pls ignore dead week got me like to help keep your mind sharp studying for finals well, this is all honestly way too much. either no memes are posted or all memes are. letting the mods cherry-pick their favorites is completely unfair. cater to the meme needs of all of us, not just a select few. otherwise, you shouldn't even be running this page. memes should be a public good for all. everyone deserves equal access. \n\njoining this meme page was once something to be proud of. originally, only the best memes would make it to the top. some of us, it seems, have forgotten that. even i've shitposted way too much these past few days. please, let's not forget why we once loved memes so much. hell, just read the first letter of every sentence and you'll remember. when it's already tomorrow and you still have to start work...\nso you make a miserable meme from your king-lear flavored tears what is going on here? guess people want to release the stress of finals by releasing paper on bathroom ground? when you're in eecs and need that infinite sweet meme karma for finals because anything helps at this point \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f #welcomejoseph

this to get some salt. my fellow edgy teens:\n\nfor various reasons, we here at uc berkeley memes for edgy teens have refrained from posting any explicit rules outlining what can and cannot be posted on this public forum. however, it has been brought to our attention that members in this community have felt personally targeted by recent content. in hopes to mitigate this issue, the administration and moderating team have reached the following consensus:\n\nif posted content explicitly contains an individual\u2019s personal information (e.g., their name, their photo, etc.) we will not regulate said content if the content originated in the official uc berkeley memes for edgy teen facebook. if you post anything offensive or unintentionally comical that can be made viral on the official

regulate the posted content. the moderating and administrative team has agreed upon the following provisional exceptions:\n\n\u2022 if it is brought to our attention that the individual referenced in the posted content did not willingly post the comment\n\u2022 if the content is a clear and explicit* attack against a specific individual or group of individuals (there are obvious exceptions, within limitations, with public figures, groups, and our beloved administrator, chris tril)\n\u2022 if the individual referenced in the posted content feels uncomfortable with their name being displayed. (it is the said individual\u2019s burden to first contact the original poster, and if the original poster does not respond within 36 hours or comply with the said individual\u2019s demands, the said

going to look like when i come home memes before baes, all day! happy thanksgiving cuffing season at cal i feel like this is all of u berkeley nerds (signed: a former berkeley nerd)\n\n***taken from the classical art memes page if you're interested in a animal behavior course, seats are open angry reacts only pls i'm currently at the point where i should be considering my career options after graduating berkeley eecs. life goal number one (not life goal number zero - that's to live forever) for me has been to at some point have at least a billion dollars for about as long as i can remember. it seems to me that, given my skill set and interests, the best way for me to do this is by entrepreneuring or perhaps just business-managing in the tech industry. so, as a huge fan of google, i decided about six months ago that being the ceo of google is my primary objective in life; i'm smart enough to have a pretty good chance at pulling it off, and there's much less competition to become the ceo of google than there is to grow your own start-up into a multi-billion-dollar corporation. everybody wants to start their own company; not many want to take over an existing favorite. plus, if i fail to become the ceo of google or decide i don't want to be, i could always try for one of the many other companies i like, or i could still decide to partner with a haas student (hasshole lol) to start my own company after all.\n\n(that and there's no time limit on starting my own company, while there may be one on the google thing - larry page and sergey brin are likely to step down in 2024, and their replacements will probably be in place running the company for quite a long time before i get another chance.)\n\nhowever, both larry page and eric schmidt are pretty hard to get in touch with; plus, as much admiration as i have for them, i don't really identify with either one personally. \n\nso, without further adieu, here is my point:\n\nrecently, i've begun to worry about the prospect of being a tech industry ceo, on grounds of the fact that all of them are extremely busy. it's not the workload that intimidates me; the job itself, i think, would be an enjoyable way to spend time. it's the fact that i'm afraid it may be something which goes beyond work, and takes over your entire lifestyle. i'm worried that, if i were to become ceo of google, i'd have to be ready to make a crucial decision or get to the googleplex at a moment's notice, 24/7. in this hypothetical outcome, i'd never be able to take vacations, i'd never be able to spend a few hours ignoring calls to pay attention to my family, etc. what's the point of having an $18.7 billion net worth if you never get the chance to spend a few hours walking around your city, throwing money at homeless people, stealing people's cars and replacing them with newer models, or filling every paid parking space in the city with an old car, not paying the meters, and having the cars towed, only to put each one back, and the city can't stop you because you can afford to keep paying the fines, and they don't have enough tow trucks to keep up with you?\n\nthis hypothetical outcome scares me, not because i think it's likely, but because i might have no way of finding out whether it's the case until it's too late. by the time i'm close enough with any big tech industry leaders to know what their lives are like, i've already devoted my life to getting there; it's too late to change my mind and try making a billion dollars some other way. and, even though i can rationally back it up, the statement \"the ceo of google probably isn't too busy\" still sounds rather laughable.\n\nregarding the quote from steve jobs - like i said, i would enjoy the work itself (making customers happy), but more importantly, i set out to make money because i want to make customers - or rather, people in general - happy. there's no way i could ever spend a billion dollars directly on myself; i'd want to spend it funding scientific research, and investing in start-up companies, and personal projects which benefit both myself and others (e.g., filmmaking). in fact, when i was a little kid, the biggest reason i had for wanting so much money - before i could understand things like grant money or corporate investment - was because i thought it would be awesome to have enough money that i could give a homeless person a few tens of thousands of dollars to get their life together, and barely even notice that the money is missing.\n\nwould you say it's fair to summarize your point as something like \"the job makes me busy because there's nothing i'd rather be doing?\" if so, i'm guessing that, should i be ceo of google, there will very rarely be a moment of my life where i'm doing something i enjoy more than running google. i just don't want those moments to completely disappear.\n\ni read huxley's a brave new world and it really put my thoughts into words. i mean you have the working class that is supposed to do grunt work like homework on piazza. big business wants to keep the general public from being rich which is why they stress homework for cs61a students so much. it's supposed to make you think that it's what real life is. and hilfiger's are even worse! yeah, i can look up any fact i want, but berkeley eecs just is trying to make us \"hampsters\" run through loops over and over again to see if we can remember a fist full of facts. i don't care about that. i'm an intellectual and we look what we need to and our intellegence is what puts it all together. i didn't fail berkeley, berkeley failed me.\n\nregarding warren buffet, i'm well aware of his philanthropy and non-extravagant lifestyle, and he's already a personal role model of mine. i'm planning on applying to haas as a double major to focus on nonprofit management. \n\ni apologize if i'm wasting your time at this point or coming off disrespectfully, but i certainly have thought this through, and i'm still quite certain that my concerns are valid. a rare image of me going back from croads. shitpostin' meme lovin' turkey \ud83e\udd83 sluts \n\nhappy \ud83c\udf89slutsgiving \ud83c\udf89you
