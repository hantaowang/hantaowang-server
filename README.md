I had originally learned HTML in freshman year of high school. 4 years later,
as a freshman at UC Berkeley, I enrolled in the web design decal where I learned
CSS and Jquery, along with a refresher of HTML.

The current website is my second iteration of my personal website, which I completed
independently over winter of 2016. I expect to add/remake this site when I learn Rails.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, Jquery
